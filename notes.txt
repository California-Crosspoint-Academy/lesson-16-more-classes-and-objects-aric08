Access Control (Private)

private = only usable inside its class.

Can’t access a private variable (like cost) from another class.

Objects

Usually created and declared on one line.

Anonymous objects = made without a name (often passed into methods).

References & Equality

cir2 = cir1 → both point to the same object.

== → checks if they are the same object.

.equals() → checks content (only works that way if overridden).

Strings

Use .equals() or .compareTo(), not ==.

String literals share memory (so == might sometimes work).

new String() makes a new object (so == is false).

Other Rules

A variable name is just a pointer—you can reassign it.

No access modifier = package access.

Instance vars auto-init to 0; local vars don’t—must assign before use.
